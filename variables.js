//js has commonly three types of data types i.e. var,let and const. 
//var is used when we have define global variables
//let is used to define and declare variable around the scope
//const value is defined and intialize at once it cant be reintialized
var i=20;
let j=30;
const k=40;
const l="swetav";
const m=true;
const n=null;
const o=undefined;
console.log(i,j,k);
//typeof() is used to get the type of variables
console.log(typeof i,typeof j,typeof k,typeof l,typeof m, typeof n,typeof o );
